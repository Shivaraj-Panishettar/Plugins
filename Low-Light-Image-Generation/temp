# Low-Light Image Generation using Retinex Decomposition

This plugin generates low-light images from input images using Retinex Decomposition. It decomposes each image into illumination and reflectance components, modifies the illumination to simulate low-light conditions, and then recomposes the image.

## Features
- Decompose images using Retinex theory into illumination and reflectance.
- Adjust illumination to create low-light conditions.
- Save processed low-light images to a specified directory.
- Generate histograms to visualize the change in average intensity between input and output images.

## Dependencies
Ensure the following libraries are installed:
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `matplotlib`

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
