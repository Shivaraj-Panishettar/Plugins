# 🌈 RGB to Point Cloud Data (PCD) Generation Plugin (In Development) 🚧

Welcome to the **RGB to Point Cloud Data (PCD) Generation Plugin**! 🎉 This project is currently in progress and aims to convert standard **RGB images** into high-quality **3D Point Cloud Data (PCD)** by estimating depth information at multiple resolutions.

🚀 The ultimate goal is to produce accurate and detailed 3D representations for various applications like 3D reconstruction, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality!

## 🔥 Features (Work In Progress)

- 🌐 **Depth Estimation**: Generates depth maps from the input RGB image at three different resolutions:
  - **Low Resolution** for fast processing ⏱️
  - **Mid Resolution** for balanced quality ⚖️
  - **High Resolution** for the best depth detail 🔍
  
- 🛠️ **Depth Merging**: Combines the low, mid, and high-resolution depth maps into a single, more accurate depth image, improving depth accuracy.

- 📡 **PCD Generation**: Once we have the merged depth image, we generate a **Point Cloud Data (PCD)** file, which you can visualize or use for further 3D processing.

## 🛠️ Development Progress

I am currently working on optimizing the accuracy of the depth maps and merging them into a single high-quality depth image. Here's what I'm focusing on:

- 🔄 **Experimenting with Different Depth Estimation Techniques**: Exploring different approaches to improve the quality of depth at each resolution.
- ⚙️ **Fine-Tuning Resolution Levels**: Finding the sweet spot between depth quality and performance for each resolution.
- 🧩 **Improving the Merging Algorithm**: Ensuring that the combined depth image is more accurate and realistic, reducing errors in the final PCD.

## 📋 Planned Workflow

1. **Input**: RGB image (e.g., from a camera or an image file).
2. **Depth Estimation**: 
   - Calculate three separate depth maps for low, mid, and high resolution.
3. **Depth Merging**:
   - Merge the three depth maps into one high-quality depth image.
4. **PCD Generation**:
   - Generate a **Point Cloud Data (PCD)** file from the merged depth image, creating a 3D structure of the scene.
