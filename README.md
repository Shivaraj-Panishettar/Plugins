# 🌟 Welcome to My Image Processing & Conversion Plugins!

Hey there! I'm excited to share with you my collection of custom image processing and conversion plugins. This project currently features three amazing tools, and I have plans to add even more in the future. Let’s dive in! 🚀

## Current Plugins

### 1. 🌙 Low Light Image Generation
Have you ever wanted to test your algorithms in low-light conditions? This plugin is for you! It simulates low-light environments by reducing brightness and enhancing contrast, making it easier to develop and test your image processing techniques.

**What you can do:**
- Adjust darkness levels to your liking. 🌈
- Simulate noise to mimic the challenges of low-light photography. 🌫️
- Save your results in PNG or JPEG formats. 📷

### 2. 🌐 RGB to PCD Conversion
This handy tool converts your standard RGB images into point cloud data (PCD) format, which is commonly used in 3D vision tasks and LiDAR applications. With this plugin, you can easily create colorized point clouds from your images!

**Features include:**
- RGB to XYZ mapping for accurate 3D representation. 🖼️
- Adjustable depth information to fit your needs. 🔍
- Outputs in the convenient `.pcd` format. 📁

### 3. 🗃️ BIN File Generation
Need to convert RGB images into `.bin` file format for LiDAR-based projects? Look no further! This plugin makes it easy to transform your 2D image data into a format suitable for 3D sensor analysis.

**What you’ll get:**
- RGB to depth conversion for more insightful data. 🔄
- Configurable point density for your specific requirements. ⚙️
- Outputs as `.bin` files for easy integration. 📦

## Future Plans
I’m continuously working on expanding this project, and I have some exciting ideas for new plugins! Keep an eye out for features like:
- 🛠️ Image denoising to improve image quality.
- ✂️ Image segmentation for advanced analysis.
- 🌍 Depth map generation for richer visual information.

Stay tuned for more updates! 🔔

## How to Use
Using these plugins is a breeze! Just run the corresponding scripts with your desired inputs. For example, to generate a low-light image, you can use:
